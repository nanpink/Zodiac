				<h2>The Origin</h2>
				<p>Historically, Aries has represented a ram since late Babylonian times, though earlier it was known as
					"The Agrarian Worker" or "The Hired Man" in Babylonian astronomy.
					The shift in identification from a farmhand to a ram likely occurred due to its association with the
					god Dumuzi the Shepherd.</p>
				<h2>Dates</h2>
				<p> Governs the period from March 21 to April 19. So anyone that was born between those dates is a
					Aries.</p>
				<h2>Location</h2>
				<p> It is located in the Northern celestial hemisphere, situated between Pisces to the west and Taurus
					to the east, and lies along the ecliptic, the apparent path of the Sun across the sky. The best
					observed from September through February, with the optimal viewing time around 9 PM in early
					December.</p>
